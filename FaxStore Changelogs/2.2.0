This update brings some breaking changes as defined on [this post](https://bugs.faxes.zone/f/47) regarding the permissions of FaxStore. But, It also brings a new highly requested feature - forms. Forms can be created as forms or even as a ticket type system, it's all up to you!

**Attention License System Users**
As this update changes the permissions of FaxStore the license system is required to be updated to 1.7 to ensure you are able to have permissions on your license system.

With the previous permission system being deleted any site staff (except config owners) will lose access, access will need to be re-granted.
