#### Security

This update fixes a potential security risk for sites. This risk would come from the login page and allow one to inject JavaScript/DOM content to obtain a users information. For a full breakdown of this risk see the following document - https://weblutions.com/u/7sqAeV.pdf

- This update resolves the mentioned security risks

- Edited store item URLs now redirect to the updated URL rather than the old one - [#1911](https://bugs.weblutions.com/i/1911)
- The way emails send, they now bulk send if there's more than one recipiant to reduce rate limiting
- If there is only one store listing option, that option is set as the only button, not in a dropdown
- Store listing options dropdown buttons have changed color to the green of the 'Add to Cart' button

#### Removed

- Old statistic view routes
- `/info` has been removed as a route

#### Investigating

- We're further looking into an error `ER_TRUNCATED_WRONG_VALUE_FOR_FIELD` in the user table. We were unable to trace this directly - [#1905](https://bugs.weblutions.com/i/1905) & [#1882](https://bugs.weblutions.com/i/1882)
