## Gift cards
Gift cards have been changed near fully. For gift cards to now register, you'll need to delete existing gift cards and create them through the gift card creator in the store settings page.

Even if you don't use gift cards it's highly recommended to delete the current default ones fully from your store.

## Maintenance mode
This mode has for a long time suffered issues when trying to exit from maintenance mode. This should now be fully resolved after extensive development and live testing. Sorry for the extended delay.

## Extensions Folder
With version now ships with a new `extensions` folder. In version 2.0 the `extraFiles` config.json option will be removed.

The extension folder works like magic and currently accepts `.js` files to execute automatically. This means it's a drag and drop system with no loading configuration needed.

Current `extraFiles` config.json will continue to run for a limited time only. Consider updating as soon as possible.

## Slash Commands
As the new version ships with slash commands. You will have to reinvite your Discord bot using the below link. If not, you'll get Discord related bugs.
