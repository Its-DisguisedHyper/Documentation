There may not be a direct update any time soon for FaxStore unless it's an important fix. We're working on some beta features (teased below) which could take some time. Deluxe user will have early access to these new features.

Some things we're working on for 1.4 is; new scrollbars, profile customisation, subscription services, blog system.
