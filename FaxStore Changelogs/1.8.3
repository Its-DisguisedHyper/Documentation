This update brings one new footer related feature and some fixes and code clean up.
---
**Changes:**

- Added custom footer text that can be edited via the [Advanced Settings](https://weblutions.com/releases/34#) page
- Fixed a fatal error that occurred when the `user` command was used without mentioning a user. It now defaults to the message author
- Fixed a fatal error that was caused from a general page link having a `'` symbol in them
- Fixed an error that would be fatal when the promotion code didn't apply to the users session
- Changed and cleaned up code in various locations to improve speed and execution

This is only a smaller update but we're working on fixing all the (hidden) bugs in FaxStore currently before new features and 1.9 is created. FaxStore hasn't had a set of clean up versions since it's first release, so this is much needed.  

Be sure to report any bugs you do find.  

Also, big shout out to *[Pluto](https://faxes.zone/partner/pluto)* for help with this update.


# HOTFIX
This update fixed the issue were FaxStore customers couldn't start their application due to a licensing error.  

This is now fixed.

All you have to do is replace the following files;
`index.js`, `backend.js`, `updatemanager.js`, `/views`
