As we prepare for a new seem less system to allow you to create a store without needing a server or web experience we've been hard at work making FaxStore perform for this transition. This update brings a new mandatory login method â€” Standard Logins (SL), SLs are a new way to be able to login to your store with just a username (email) and password. Allowing for accounts to be created without needing a third party for social logins.

**Please note it is recommended to update ToS and privacy policy pages to reflect the storage of sensitive information, new data includes; passwords.**
