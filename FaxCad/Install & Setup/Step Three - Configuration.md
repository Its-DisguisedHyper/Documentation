It's time to start configuring your site in the configuration file (`config.json`).

This section covers a variable documentation table on every single item inside the config file along with what it is and does as well as how to configure it.

### Discord Login
Although the most common Discord offers a range of out of app features which echo into the Discord platform that other services don't provide.

First things first, create a Discord application through the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

Now on the OAuth2 page you will need to add the following as a redirect and replace the domain with yours. This is used in our login callback to actually log the user in.

```
https://example.com/auth/discord/callback
```
*Change `example.com` to represent your domain name.*

Now, copy the Client ID and place it in the config file of FaxCad under the `tokens` section. Also copy the Client Secret from the Discord page into your FaxCad config.
