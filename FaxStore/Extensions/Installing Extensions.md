FaxStore has a great ability to build custom extensions along with use ones the community or Weblutions has to offer. In fact many are [published to the official FaxStore extensions Github](https://github.com/FAXES/faxstore-extensions).

The majority of extensions are a drop and drop installation. Follow the below install steps unless otherwise provided by the extension author.

1. Download the extension file (usually just a `.js` file).
2. Open the FTP service for your machine (like WinSCP) and go to the extensions directory within FaxStore.
3. Place the downloaded file in this area and configure the file if required.
4. Restart FaxStore to load the new extension, you should have a pop up on boot mentioning it's been started.
