HTTP requests allow you to create nicely displayed HTTP requests with their formats on a page.

```
/POST /spider/redback
Redback are cool, they can kill, they can die, they can eat, and, they can sleep. Redbacks, the ultimate spider!

- BYTE The byte property of the spider

= if(this == that) {
    return 'Returned';
}
/POST
```
